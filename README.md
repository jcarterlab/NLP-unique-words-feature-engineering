# NLP-unique-words-feature-engineering

An initial feature engineering notebook for a Kaggle student essay scoring competition suggested somewhat suprisingly a negative correlation between unique words and essay score. This notebook shows how misspelled words significantly contributed to that result. It also outlines how using a fixed number of words (in this case the first 60 was deemed optimal) can prevent multicollinearity with other features.
